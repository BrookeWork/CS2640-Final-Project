 The main gameplay loop of sudoku will be handled by the file sudoku.asm. 

 1.   sudoku asm will first run generate_puzzle. 

 2.   Then it will welcome the player to sudoku, explain sudoku rules, and ask whether the user wants to play or exit. 

 3.   If the user chooses to play, the puzzle is displayed using print_grid. 

 4.   Then it will prompt the user for the row number and column number. 

 5.   Once these are entered, if the cell location is invalid or there is already a value in that cell, it will reject it and reprompt until valid values for a cell are entered. 

 6.   Then it will prompt for a number to place in that cell until the user enters a value from 1 to 9. 

 7.   Then the number is placed in that cell.  

 8.   The grid is checked by the verify_grid macro to see if the user won the game. 

 9.   If the user does not win yet, the user is prompted to either proceed or exit. 

 10.   Steps 3-10 are repeated until the user chooses to exit in step 10, or if the user is found to have won the game in step 8. 
 
 11.   If the user is found to have won in step 8, the player’s win is announced to the player, and the player is asked to either play or again or quit.
